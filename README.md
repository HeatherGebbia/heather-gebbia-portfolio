# Customer Agreement Web Application  

A demo web application originally built in **VB.NET Web Forms** and migrated to **C# Web Forms** to modernize the codebase. This project is hosted on **Microsoft Azure** with a **SQL Server Database backend**, and serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my skills in C#, ASP.NET, and Azure.
